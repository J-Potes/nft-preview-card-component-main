## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that you can change properties of a child class with hover or active. Previously I thought that you could only change the attribute of the same class when hovering.

```css
.card__image:hover .card__image--h {
    visibility: visible;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
